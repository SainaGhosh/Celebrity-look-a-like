# Session 1: Brace yourselves, folks !

Let's get started with the basic image processing operations:
Install the dependencies.

```sh
$ pip3 install numpy
$ pip3 install opencv-python3 
$ pip3 install matplotlib 
$ pip3 install scikit-learn 
```

# Few basic image processing operations

1. Read an image using OpenCV
2. Resize the image
3. Grayscale the image
4. Perform affine transformations - Image Cropping, scaling, rotation 
(ref: https://setosa.io/ev/image-kernels/)
5. Color spacing (only red component)
6. **Mini project 1** - Live sketching 
    1.  Take a video (or use webcam)
    2.  Read the video frames
    3. Process each frame 
    4. Apply different kernels on image - sharpening, blurring, edge detection, binarization
*Show your creativity, folks !*
    5. Write frame in the output video and display the frame for your reference
    6. Upload the output video on drive
